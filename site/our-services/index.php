							<h3>Termite Treatment</h3>
							<p>We specialize in the non-evasive treatment offered by Termidor S.C. Perimeter Plus. This allows the applicator to avoid drilling the interior and exterior coverings of your home.

							<h3>Pre-Construction Treatment</h3>
							<p>If you are building a new home this is the least expensive and the best time to place a protective barrier for your home. The termiticide is applied to areas that will be enclosed forever. Contact your contractor for the proper time to treat your investment.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="col">
							<h3>Mold and Fungus Treatment</h3>
							<p>Mold and Fungus is a major destroyer of your homes structural soundness and value. The state mandates that if a liquid application is applied, increased ventilation and moisture barrier must be put in place. Increased ventilation and moisture barrier will correct the problem. If the moisture levels are dropped then the molds and fungus are considered inactive.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col">
							<h3>Moisture Barrier Installation</h3>
							<p>A moisture barrier is a material that stops the flow of moisture. Moisture can decrease the effectiveness of insulation, loosen plaster, blister paint and lead to structural damage of your home. A moisture barrier is installed to stop the capillary rise of moisture in the soil from becoming airborne vapor.</p>
						</div>
						
						<div class="col">
							<h3>Temp-Vents</h3>
							<p>Ventilation is the main defense against excess moisture and foundation decay, as well as aiding in termite control! The installation of a Temp-Vent can save you fuel, money, and time while helping to prevent frozen water and sewer pipes. It is no electricity needed and will automatically open at 70 Deg. F. and close at 40 Deg. F.</p>
						</div>
